# 蓝窗信使 Design QA

## Source visual truth

- Reference: `/Users/canghe/Library/Containers/at.EternalStorms.Yoink/Data/Documents/YoinkPromisedFiles.noIndex/yoinkFilePromiseCreationFolder7D3018CF-CA75-40E5-9F3A-1CE897CF3790/add7D3018CF-CA75-40E5-9F3A-1CE897CF3790/WecomSave_62db42e880bd9924483d51639eace46b.png`
- Target state: 2007-style blue desktop messenger, task page, three-column shell, buddy rail open.

## Implementation evidence

- Store preview: `assets/presets/blue-window-messenger/preview.png`
- Desktop renderer capture: `tmp/blue-window-v2-render.png`
- Narrow renderer capture: `tmp/blue-window-v2-narrow.png`
- Full reference/implementation comparison: `tmp/blue-window-reference-vs-render.png`
- Focused header/right-rail comparison: `tmp/blue-window-focused-compare.png`
- Desktop viewport: 1065 × 780 CSS px, captured at 2× device scale.
- Narrow viewport: 760 × 570 CSS px, captured at 2× device scale.

## Findings

- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain.
- Layout and spacing: the implementation matches the reference's dark XP title bar, large task toolbar, approximately 22/58/20 three-column body, dense left project tree, dominant white task surface, right buddy rail, composer, and bottom status bar.
- Typography: Tahoma/Segoe UI/Microsoft YaHei fallbacks, compact line heights, and the final larger type scale reproduce the source density without sacrificing readability.
- Colors and surfaces: glossy cobalt title chrome, pale blue panels, sharp cyan borders, white content surfaces, green online indicators, and restrained amber highlights track the reference palette.
- Content: the center task copy and three migration command blocks match the reference hierarchy. Product labels were adapted to current Codex concepts rather than copying obsolete messenger functions literally.
- Images: `mascot.png`, `background-v2.png`, and `stamp.png` are original theme assets. The second buddy is an original adult developer character; no reference character, logo, or third-party UI asset was copied.
- Icons: visible controls use the project's existing Lucide icon system. Decorative injected runtime labels remain non-interactive so they cannot impersonate native Codex navigation.
- Interaction: toolbar selection and composer send were exercised in the rendered preview; both state changes completed successfully.
- Console: no application errors were emitted during desktop or narrow rendering. The temporary offscreen QA harness produced only Electron's expected development CSP warning.
- Accessibility: interactive elements are native buttons, inputs, and textarea controls with accessible labels where needed. Decorative window controls are marked `aria-hidden`; text contrast is strong on all primary surfaces.

## Responsive verification

- 1065px: full three-column layout, complete buddy rail and composer, no horizontal overflow.
- 760px: compact icon-only task toolbar, readable center task flow, three-column personality retained.
- Runtime injection: right rail hides below 900px; task toolbar hides below 720px. A short-window media rule reduces mascot and buddy art heights at 760px viewport height or below.

## Comparison history

1. The earlier theme preview was a simplified two-column browser-like shell. It did not match the supplied task toolbar, left project tree, title chrome, or structured right buddy rail (P1).
2. Rebuilt the preview and injected chrome as a three-column XP messenger shell and added a reference-derived pale blue star/bubble texture.
3. First combined comparison showed undersized typography and excessive information density (P2). Increased title, toolbar, navigation, document, code, composer, and status type scales.
4. Second comparison showed the lower buddy panel was too short and used a generic icon (P2). Added an original full-body developer buddy asset, routed the theme stamp asset through the runtime injection payload, and enlarged the friend panel.
5. Final combined and focused comparisons show the target hierarchy, scale, palette, and right-rail personality are aligned. Remaining differences are intentional product substitutions: current Codex icons/content and original character art.

## Test gap

- [P3] The injected theme source, payload assembly, responsive rules, and package assets are covered by build/tests, but a fresh screenshot inside the live Codex window was not captured in this pass because the local Mac UI session was locked. This does not block the store preview or package implementation.

## Final result

# AI 主题连续创作与多候选 Design QA

## Comparison target

- Source visual truth: `/Users/canghe/.codex/generated_images/019f8e03-7663-7d43-941f-9b4008b07bf4/call_mAUST5Ch0EQ6ubq5q4MPFLSP.png`.
- Live implementation: Electron AI studio with the real `静海穹顶` smoke-test session.
- Desktop viewport: `945 × 715`; narrow viewport: `760 × 715`.
- Target state: large real Codex preview, three complete image candidates, immutable v1/v2/v3 timeline, continuous conversation, adopted revision, and an enabled post-apply composer.

## Findings

No actionable P0, P1, or P2 visual or interaction differences remain.

- Layout: the live desktop keeps the selected design's preview-first composition, candidate strip and revision timeline on the left, and durable conversation panel on the right. The smaller live viewport reduces card widths without displacing the primary actions.
- Responsive behavior: the application minimum width is now `760px`. Below `900px`, the conversation becomes a labelled bottom drawer with a dimmed backdrop and explicit collapse action; the preview, candidates, and versions remain independently scrollable.
- Images: the smoke test generated exactly three real image assets. Each card uses the generated preview URL and retains its independent slot and SHA-256; no placeholder or duplicated visual is presented as a completed candidate.
- Versions: v1, v2, and v3 remain selectable in a horizontal timeline. Restoring v1 changes only the active preview, and the later revisions remain visible.
- Conversation: user instructions, AI summaries, running progress, revision labels, retry/stop surfaces, and the two adjustment modes share one persistent thread.
- Controls: settings open above the narrow drawer, the candidate count is visibly set to three, and adopt/apply actions retain the existing warm-gold action hierarchy.
- Accessibility: tabs, candidate toggles, revision buttons, composer modes, drawer controls, and dialogs expose readable names and native control semantics. Hidden narrow-screen drawer content is removed from keyboard focus with CSS visibility.

## Interaction and runtime verification

1. Started a real `3`-candidate session. Completion advanced through `1/3`, `2/3`, and `3/3`; the job remained `generating-images` after the first two images and entered `awaiting-selection` only after all three existed.
2. Selected candidate 2 and generated v1.
3. Sent two consecutive `仅调整主题` messages. They created v2 and v3 while the selected candidate SHA-256 stayed `bd089af4d967b8e02a40ec520fb2cdcc7c45d135e72cab43de9d11acbded7a11`.
4. Restored v1 without deleting v2/v3, adopted it as the local theme `静海穹顶`, and applied it successfully.
5. Confirmed the global current-theme status updated to `静海穹顶` and the same conversation composer remained enabled after application.
6. Restart migration was exercised against two legacy completed sessions; each was normalized to one candidate batch and one immutable revision.
7. Final automated verification: TypeScript/Astro checks passed with zero diagnostics, all `167` tests passed, Electron production build passed, and `git diff --check` passed.

## Comparison history

1. The selected reference established a large preview, three-image candidate row, revision strip, and right-side continuous conversation.
2. Initial implementation matched the desktop hierarchy, but live QA exposed an unreachable narrow breakpoint because Electron enforced a `920px` minimum width.
3. Lowered the supported minimum to `760px` and replaced the stacked narrow conversation with a real bottom drawer.
4. Narrow QA exposed the settings modal behind the open drawer. Opening settings now closes the drawer first, preserving the modal's visual and pointer hierarchy.
5. Desktop QA exposed a mobile collapse icon through a selector-specificity conflict. The close control is now visible only inside the narrow drawer.
6. Final side-by-side review confirms the selected composition, real three-candidate state, conversation density, action hierarchy, and responsive behavior.

final result: passed

# 创作者中心「作品库＋常驻详情」Design QA

## Comparison target

- Source visual truth: `/Users/canghe/.codex/generated_images/019f8e03-7663-7d43-941f-9b4008b07bf4/call_8Bu69fg4zjHYjaF7exWmrMZw.png`
- Rendered implementation: `/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/tmp/design-qa/creator-center-implementation-01.png`
- Full-view comparison: `/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/tmp/design-qa/creator-center-comparison-01.png`
- Focused inspector comparison: `/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/tmp/design-qa/creator-center-inspector-comparison-01.png`
- CSS viewport/state: full-screen Electron window at `1147 × 716`, authenticated creator with six real local works, first work selected, all-work filter, dark theme.
- Source pixels: `1487 × 1058`.
- Implementation pixels: `1147 × 716`.
- Density normalization: the source was top-aligned and cover-cropped to `1147 × 716`; the implementation is a native `1147 × 716` Computer Use capture treated as 1× desktop density. Both were placed in one side-by-side comparison input.
- State normalization note: the source intentionally illustrates three marketplace works with approved/review/rejected states and populated analytics. The implementation uses the signed-in account's six real, not-yet-submitted local works and therefore shows draft status and zero analytics.

## Findings

No actionable P0, P1, or P2 visual or interaction differences remain.

- Fonts and typography: the existing SF Pro Text / PingFang SC system stack, warm-white headings, muted metadata, compact status text, numeric metrics, truncation, and optical weights preserve the selected mock's hierarchy at the smaller live viewport.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the implementation keeps the selected direction's two-column work library and persistent inspector at desktop width. Header, filter/search toolbar, two-card grid, large preview, review path, metrics, chart, and version history follow the mock's order and grouping. The smaller 716px-tall display scrolls lower history content without hiding persistent primary controls.
- Colors and visual tokens: the application keeps its warm-ink background, honey-gold selection/action state, restrained borders, green/warn/red semantic statuses, and low-elevation panels. Tokens remain aligned with the selected visual and the rest of the Electron client.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: cards and the inspector use each real local theme's generated `previewUrl`; previews are sharp, correctly cropped, and open into a contain-fitted full-screen view. No placeholder artwork, CSS drawing, or fabricated production metric is used.
- Copy and content: work status, review stages, timestamps, reviewer reason, unique users, creator rewards, recent use, price, version history, and the deduplication note use marketplace terminology from the implemented product rules. Empty-filter copy was made specific rather than falsely claiming the account has no works.
- Icons: visible controls use the project's Lucide family with consistent stroke weight and sizing. Card selection, search, review steps, metrics, publish, overflow actions, and preview controls remain optically aligned.
- States and interactions: work-card selection updates the inspector; status tabs and search narrow both the library and detail state; an empty result offers “查看全部作品”; large preview opens and closes; the publish form opens as a modal with the selected real preview and keeps submission disabled until rights confirmation.
- Accessibility: the filters use tab semantics, search has an accessible label and clear action, work cards are native buttons, dialogs are modal-labelled, preview images have descriptive alt text, and disabled/pending actions remain explicit.

## Comparison history

1. Desktop preflight at `1147 × 716` exposed fixed grid minimums of `430px + 480px` inside a padded `911px` main region, producing horizontal document overflow (P2).
2. Reduced the desktop tracks to `minmax(360px, .96fr)` and `minmax(380px, 1.04fr)`. The post-fix implementation capture shows both columns fully contained, the inspector's right edge visible, and no horizontal scrollbar.
3. Interaction testing found that a zero-result status filter left the previously selected work visible in the inspector, creating a contradictory state (P2 behavior).
4. Scoped selection to `filteredWorks` and added a specific empty inspector state with a working “查看全部作品” recovery action.
5. The final full-view and focused comparisons confirm the selected portfolio-grid/detail-inspector composition, typography, token mapping, real preview treatment, and core interaction states. Remaining data differences are intentional live-data constraints, not design drift.
6. Follow-up testing at the Electron minimum width (`920 × 620`) showed the old `1050px` breakpoint moving the entire inspector below the work library (P2 responsive behavior).
7. Replaced that stack with compact two-column tracks, a one-column work-card rail, and narrower page gaps. Added a manually collapsible `236px → 72px` app sidebar that defaults to compact mode in narrow windows and persists the user's choice. The `920 × 648` proof capture at `tmp/design-qa/creator-center-responsive-920.png` keeps the work library and inspector side by side with no horizontal overflow.

## Verification

- Primary work selection and inspector update: passed.
- Status filters, empty state, recovery action, search, and clear search: passed.
- Large preview open/close: passed.
- Publish modal open/close and selected-preview binding: passed.
- Rights-gated submit button: passed; no submission was sent during visual QA.
- Responsive minimum window: passed at `920 × 648`; work library and inspector remain side by side, with the local work cards using a compact single-column rail.
- Sidebar responsiveness: passed in both expanded and collapsed states; the toggle is keyboard-labelled, collapsed navigation retains accessible names/tooltips, and the preference persists locally.
- Full-screen desktop: passed; two columns remain visible without horizontal overflow.
- Renderer/runtime check: no new renderer exception appeared during this creator-center pass. Existing production-host 404s are expected until the already implemented marketplace endpoints are deployed.
- Supabase relationship check: the two opposing foreign keys were confirmed in the live schema, and the creator query now explicitly uses `theme_submissions_theme_id_fkey` to avoid PostgREST ambiguity.
- TypeScript and Astro checks: passed with zero errors or warnings.
- Automated tests: 163 passed.
- Electron production build and `git diff --check`: passed.

## Follow-up polish

- [P3] After the creator metrics endpoint is deployed and the account has an approved submission, capture one populated state to verify four-digit reward values, reviewer notes, and a non-zero 30-day trend against the same inspector layout.
- [P3] The selected concept shows three curated marketplace states above the fold; the implementation deliberately preserves all six real local works and lets the page scroll rather than hiding or inventing data.

final result: passed

- 类型检查、65 项测试、Electron 生产构建和 `git diff --check` 全部通过。

## Comparison history

1. 第一轮实现已完成四步结构，但编辑主题名占据两行，步骤栏过窄；布局缩略图和右侧预览的视觉重量也小于参考图（P2）。
2. 将标题改为固定页面名与可截断编辑状态标签，把步骤栏独立成整行，并按参考图调整底部按钮顺序与文案。
3. 放大八张布局缩略图、提高右侧预览纵向比例，并将并不存在自动分析的“根据图片构图推荐”改为准确的“当前布局的画面建议”。
4. 1024px 检查发现布局标题被说明文案挤压（P2）；在中等宽度下把标题与说明改为上下排列。760px 检查发现底部状态摘要挤压主要操作（P2）；窄窗口隐藏该次要摘要并保留上一步、下一步和保存草稿。
5. 最终同视口并排对照确认四步层级、卡片密度、预览权重、选中态和贴底操作与图 3 的设计意图一致；剩余差异来自真实 Codex 预览内容与产品原生顶栏，属于有意的产品适配。

# 曜月谪仙全窗口沉浸式 Design QA

## Source visual truth

- User-approved reference: `/Users/canghe/.codex/generated_images/019f6d53-2b44-7703-8395-9bdf833bf567/exec-15a67e34-bab5-44bb-adbc-5730f96e16f0.png`.
- Target state: one continuous xianxia image covering the full application window, with the silver-haired swordsman remaining dominant on the right and real Codex navigation, conversation, task cards, and composer floating above it as translucent glass layers.
- The applied theme uses the separate no-UI `hero.png` as runtime wallpaper. The approved concept is used as the store preview only, so fake controls are never baked into the interactive application surface.

## Implementation evidence

- Desktop light home: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-full-window-home-v2.png`.
- Desktop task: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-full-window-task.png`.
- Desktop dark compact: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-full-window-dark-compact.png`.
- Narrow 520px task: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-full-window-narrow-520.png`.
- Full source/implementation comparison: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-full-window-comparison.png`.
- Focused art/glass comparison: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-full-window-focus-comparison.png`.
- Primary viewport: 1280px preview width. Responsive verification: 520px preview width.
- States exercised: home, task, light, dark, compact, composer focus/input, and narrow sidebar.

## Findings

- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain.
- Background continuity: the production art now covers sidebar, top bar, home, task, and composer areas as one fixed image. There is no second hero panel, repeated subject, black fallback, or edge seam.
- Hierarchy and readability: navigation uses deep navy glass; messages use medium-density blue glass; code uses a dense navy surface; task cards and composer use pale frosted surfaces. The character and sword-light field remain visible without competing with code.
- Source fidelity: both layouts preserve the reference's dark-blue left rail, translucent top chrome, upper-left conversation/code block, four lower task cards, bottom composer, and dominant right-side character field. The production art has a brighter cloud-city composition than the concept, but retains the approved pose, palette, energy, and full-window intent.
- Typography and controls: all live copy remains selectable, existing Lucide icons remain consistent with the product, and focus states use a visible ice-blue ring. No rasterized text or fake controls are used in runtime UI.
- Theme isolation: runtime selectors are scoped by `data-dream-theme="moonlit-immortal"`; other full-canvas presets keep their existing surfaces and backgrounds.
- Fallback behavior: the body retains a deep-navy color behind the wallpaper, preventing a black screen if the image fails to load.

## Interaction and responsive verification

- Home and task views rendered from the normalized production preset and the specialized real React preview.
- Light/dark and compact controls changed active state successfully.
- Home and task composers accepted text and retained readable focus styling over the wallpaper.
- At 520px, the sidebar collapses to an icon rail, content remains readable, and no persistent control is horizontally clipped.
- Browser console inspection showed no application errors, failed asset requests, or React runtime exceptions.
- Type checks, all 61 theme/engine tests, desktop production build, website production build, and whitespace validation passed after implementation.

## Comparison history

1. The prior theme constrained the art to a local hero/content field, so the left navigation and app chrome did not feel like part of the same scene.
2. Added a theme-ID-scoped full-window runtime layer and a specialized interactive preview using the production no-UI hero.
3. Balanced opacity by surface importance: deep navigation, translucent messages, dense code, pale task cards, and a focused glass composer.
4. Replaced the store preview with the user-approved full-window concept while keeping the original preview recoverable at `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-preview-before-full-window.png` during this work session.
5. Side-by-side full and focused comparisons confirm the intended composition and surface hierarchy. No further P0/P1/P2 differences remain.

## Follow-up polish

- [P3] Capture the freshly reapplied theme in the signed installed Mac build when a native UI session is available.
- [P3] Repeat the `codexui://theme/moonlit-immortal` smoke test in the next signed release package.

# 七秀镜湖 Design QA

## Source visual truth

- Reference: `/Users/canghe/.codex/generated_images/019f6d53-2b44-7703-8395-9bdf833bf567/exec-edf2ad85-8b31-42af-8198-42e1f026a565.png`
- Target state: an airy Mirror Lake dawn scene with a rose-and-ivory ribbon swordswoman on the far left, a minimal top navigation, five hanging file tabs, a horizontal silk-scroll work surface split into three chapters, a floating composer, and a slim status line.
- The implementation is evaluated as a new interactive `silk-scroll` layout, not as a rasterized UI screenshot. Scenic art, character art, and silk texture are production assets; navigation, tabs, controls, task content, and responsive states remain code-native and interactive.

## Implementation evidence

- Production scenic hero: `assets/presets/mirror-lake-ribbon/hero.png`
- Production character stamp: `assets/presets/mirror-lake-ribbon/stamp.png`
- Production silk texture: `assets/presets/mirror-lake-ribbon/wallpaper.png`
- Browser-rendered home preview: `tmp/design-qa/mirror-lake-home.png`
- Browser-rendered task preview: `tmp/design-qa/mirror-lake-task-v2.png`
- Browser-rendered dark compact state: `tmp/design-qa/mirror-lake-dark-compact.png`
- Browser-rendered 520px container state: `tmp/design-qa/mirror-lake-narrow.png`
- Browser-rendered website detail after title fix: `tmp/design-qa/mirror-lake-site-top-v2.png`
- Full source/implementation comparison: `tmp/design-qa/mirror-lake-full-comparison.jpg`
- Focused scroll/workbench comparison: `tmp/design-qa/mirror-lake-focus-comparison.jpg`
- Viewport: 1280 × 720 CSS px at 2× device scale; full component capture 1280 × 854 px. Responsive check used a 520px component container in the same browser viewport.
- State: `silk-scroll`, desktop home and task previews, light, dark, compact, narrow responsive composition, and Chinese website detail.

## Findings

- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain.
- Fonts and typography: the implementation uses a Songti/STSong/Noto Serif CJK display stack for the editorial wuxia hierarchy, with a system sans stack for compact navigation and a monospaced stack for file tabs and code. The source's title-to-chapter scale, restrained weights, tracking, and bilingual micro-labels are preserved without rasterizing live copy.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the live preview keeps the swordswoman on the far-left scenic field, centers the title above five suspended file tabs, and places three equal chapters inside a single horizontal silk surface. Scroll rods, thin dividers, floating composer, and bottom status bar preserve the source's proportions. At 520px, the chapter grid becomes a vertical scroll flow, only three useful file tabs remain visible, and persistent composer/status controls stay reachable.
- Colors and tokens: ivory, blush rose, muted rose-gold, lake teal, warm brown ink, and pale mist map directly to light tokens. Dark mode uses plum-brown silk, cream text, rose active states, teal success states, and a controlled scenic veil; all primary copy remains legible.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: the 1672 × 941 hero is a clean full-bleed environment with the original adult swordswoman isolated on the left and a low-detail center/right field. The 1254 × 1254 stamp provides a dedicated high-resolution character view. The 2172 × 724 silk texture keeps the central 80 percent calm for readable task content. None contains UI, logos, text, watermarks, placeholder art, CSS drawings, or handcrafted SVG substitutes.
- Copy and content: `七秀镜湖 · MIRROR LAKE RIBBON`, `剑舞已定 · 湖光正明`, and `一卷湖光，写尽风华` form one coherent theme voice. Home chapters explain the theme's actual implementation; task chapters use realistic user request, code change, and status content. Public copy labels the work as a fan theme and makes no official-game claim.
- Icons and controls: all visible controls use the existing Lucide icon family and native buttons. Light/dark/compact toggles, navigation buttons, file-tab active state, composer controls, and task CTA all expose visible hover/focus or selected states. Decorative injected tabs are `aria-hidden` with the theme chrome and do not impersonate native Codex actions.
- Accessibility: focus-visible rings are present; semantic buttons have labels where icon-only; text/background tokens remain readable in light and dark states; the narrow layout avoids horizontal overflow; reduced-motion behavior inherits the existing theme engine rule.

## Interaction and responsive verification

- Home and task previews rendered from the real normalized preset and all three production assets.
- Light, dark, and compact controls were clicked in the in-app browser. The final DOM state was `silk-scroll-preview--dark silk-scroll-preview--compact`; three chapters and the send control remained present.
- The 520px container test produced one chapter column, three visible file tabs, a scrollable workbench, and no document-level horizontal overflow.
- A fresh in-app browser tab reported zero console errors for the preview route after exercising dark and compact interactions.
- Website detail rendered at `/themes/mirror-lake-ribbon` with the correct preview, description, `silk-scroll` layout fact, version, download link, and one-click theme action. Chinese and English detail routes were generated by the production build.
- Type checking, all 61 unit tests, Electron production build, and Astro production build passed. The web build generated 15 Chinese and 15 English theme detail pages.

## Comparison history

1. The first combined full and focused comparisons showed that the new layout preserved the source's dominant horizontal scroll, left-side character field, centered file ribbons, three-chapter hierarchy, floating composer, and misty rose/teal palette. No P0/P1/P2 theme-layout mismatch was found.
2. The first website detail capture exposed the long bilingual title extending beyond the intended heading region (P2 typography/responsiveness).
3. Added a flexible min-width heading track, a 1060px title measure, `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, and a reduced responsive display clamp in `web/src/styles/global.css`.
4. Recaptured the website as `mirror-lake-site-top-v2.png`. The title now fits inside a 1060px box, the document reports no horizontal overflow, and the preview/install grid remains visible above the fold.
5. The post-fix full, focused, dark, task, narrow, and website evidence leaves no actionable P0/P1/P2 findings.

## Follow-up polish

- [P3] Capture the freshly applied theme inside a live Codex task window after the next packaged desktop build is launched.
- [P3] Repeat the installed-app `codexui://theme/mirror-lake-ribbon` smoke test after the next signed Mac package is produced.

# 山海灵境 Design QA

## Source visual truth

- Reference: `/Users/canghe/.codex/generated_images/019f6d53-2b44-7703-8395-9bdf833bf567/call_dfgM2i2N3rKKRzG0eTsotCbU.png`
- Target state: an original guoman-inspired dark Codex workspace with ink-wash mountains, jade spirit light, antique-gold contour lines, a spirit-engineer companion, and a white jade guardian beast.
- The source is an aspirational task-screen composition. The implementation is intentionally evaluated as the same art direction expressed through the existing `full-canvas` theme engine, not as a new hard-coded three-column application layout.

## Implementation evidence

- Browser-rendered home preview: `tmp/design-qa/shanhai-home.png`
- Browser-rendered task preview: `tmp/design-qa/shanhai-task.png`
- Full source/implementation comparison: `tmp/design-qa/shanhai-full-comparison.png`
- Focused character and guardian comparison: `tmp/design-qa/shanhai-focus-comparison.png`
- Viewport: 1228 × 768 CSS px.
- State: `full-canvas`, desktop, light and dark palettes checked, compact state checked, home and task previews checked.

## Findings

- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain.
- Fonts and typography: the implementation keeps the product's live system type for readability while preserving the source's gold-and-jade hierarchy through badges, status copy, and short Chinese theme copy. The source's decorative calligraphy remains in the store preview only; live controls are not replaced with rasterized text.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the real theme uses a calm full-width hero, a readable left text zone, and a right character zone. Suggestion cards remain interactive product components below the art instead of being baked into the illustration.
- Colors and tokens: midnight ink surfaces, warm ivory text, jade-teal accents, vermilion secondary color, and antique-gold borders all map directly to theme tokens. Body and panel contrast remains strong in both palette modes.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: the production hero removes all mock UI while retaining the same original spirit-engineer, white jade guardian, cloud sea, moon, red sun, floating citadel, and gold linework. The focused comparison shows the character silhouettes and cyan talisman are preserved without CSS or SVG substitutes.
- Copy and content: `山海灵境 · SHANHAI NEXUS`, `灵息在线 · 云海待命`, and `以代码为笔，绘山海新章` form a coherent product voice without copying third-party franchise names or characters.
- Icons and controls: existing Lucide controls and native buttons remain live. The concept's decorative toolbar glyphs are treated as inspiration rather than nonfunctional replicas.
- Accessibility: primary text is warm ivory on near-black surfaces, controls remain semantic buttons, and both preview mode toggles and compact state remain keyboard-operable.

## Interaction and responsive verification

- Home and task previews both rendered successfully from the real normalized preset.
- Light/dark toggle changed to its active state; both palettes intentionally share the dark art direction.
- Compact mode changed to its active state and returned cleanly.
- Website production build generated Chinese and English detail routes for `/themes/shanhai-nexus`.
- The full native Mac window could not be captured because the local UI session was locked. The engine payload, browser-rendered product components, package assets, unit test, type checks, and production builds cover the implementation path; this is a P3 evidence gap.

## Comparison history

1. Initial concept used one composite screenshot containing both art and application UI.
2. Split the visual into a production 16:9 live-interface hero and a separate square guardian stamp, removing all baked-in UI, text, logos, and controls.
3. First browser render confirmed the text-safe left field, right-side subject crop, dark surface contrast, and full-canvas composition. No P0/P1/P2 mismatch was found, so no visual fix iteration was required.
4. Full-view and focused side-by-side comparisons confirm that the ink-mountain hierarchy, jade glow, gold linework, character silhouette, guardian design, and cinematic mood remain aligned. Differences in page structure are intentional existing-engine constraints, not visual regressions.

## Follow-up polish

- [P3] Capture the freshly applied theme inside a live Codex task window after the Mac session is unlocked.

# Codex-UI 官网 Design QA

## Source visual truth

- Reference home capture: `/tmp/codex-ui-qa/reference-home.png`
- Reference detail capture: `/tmp/codex-ui-qa/reference-detail.png`
- Reference: `https://codexui.ai/`，仅用于编辑式标题、大留白、主题大图和详情页节奏；品牌、文案、主题与安装路径均为本项目原创实现。

## Implementation evidence

- Home capture: `/tmp/codex-ui-qa/implementation-home.png`
- Theme detail capture: `/tmp/codex-ui-qa/implementation-detail.png`
- Full home comparison: `/tmp/codex-ui-qa/home-comparison.jpg`
- Detail comparison: `/tmp/codex-ui-qa/detail-comparison.jpg`
- Browser-rendered viewport: 1229 × 720 CSS px.
- States checked: Chinese home, Chinese Blue Window detail, English theme gallery, 15-card gallery inventory, canonical/alternate metadata, and production download URLs.
- Browser console: no warnings or errors.

## Findings

- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain.
- Fonts and typography: editorial Songti/Times display stacks reproduce the reference hierarchy while the sans/mono stacks keep product copy and metadata compact and readable.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the implementation retains the reference's quiet header, oversized two-column hero, image-led gallery, and image/install-panel detail composition. Section spacing is intentionally generous and card chrome remains minimal.
- Colors and tokens: the reference lavender field is adapted to the product's warm paper, Blue Window cobalt, pale cyan, and navy tokens. Contrast remains strong for primary copy and actions.
- Image quality: all visible product imagery comes from the real built-in theme previews. Astro emits responsive WebP variants; the Blue Window mascot is used as the real brand mark.
- Copy and content: the site explains the actual local injection model, Codex CLI generation, unsigned Beta limitation, Apple-silicon scope, and explicit confirmation before applying a web-requested theme.
- Accessibility and interaction: semantic navigation, skip link, native buttons/details, focus-visible states, labeled dialog, Escape dismissal, reduced-motion handling, and keyboard-restored focus are implemented.

## Comparison history

1. First browser capture showed the Hero preview retaining its intrinsic 1560px height, which pushed the headline below the fold (P1).
2. Added global proportional image sizing, recaptured the page, and confirmed the headline, primary actions, release note, and Blue Window preview all share the first viewport.
3. Replaced the previous near-empty gradient app icon with the real Blue Window mascot after the focused header comparison showed weak brand recognition (P2).
4. Final home and detail comparisons show the intended reference rhythm with project-specific brand, copy, imagery, and one-click app flow.

## Responsive and interaction verification

- CSS breakpoints cover three-, two-, and one-column galleries at 1080px, 820px, and 590px, collapse feature/step grids, move the detail install panel below the preview, and replace desktop navigation with a labeled menu.
- The connected browser's temporary viewport override did not change its fixed in-app viewport, so a mobile browser screenshot could not be captured in this run. The responsive rules remain production-built and type-checked; this is a P3 evidence gap rather than an observed responsive defect.
- The browser security policy blocked executing the external `codexui://` protocol. URL parsing, malicious-input rejection, queued delivery, and renderer confirmation are covered by code tests and production builds; the native installed-app round trip remains a real-machine release smoke test.

## Final result

final result: passed

# 星愿提莫 Design QA

## Source visual truth

- Target state: a bright cute-fantasy Codex workspace with a mint-and-cream scout, red goggles, flower-tipped blowgun, mushroom backpack, starlit spores, and a cloud-top mushroom forest.
- The source is an aspirational dense three-column product concept. The implementation is evaluated as the same art direction expressed through the existing `full-canvas` theme engine, keeping live Codex controls interactive instead of baking them into the production art.

## Implementation evidence

- Browser-rendered home preview: `tmp/design-qa/starcap-home-v2.png`
- Browser-rendered dark compact state: `tmp/design-qa/starcap-home-dark-compact.png`
- Browser-rendered task preview: `tmp/design-qa/starcap-task.png`
- Browser-rendered website detail: `tmp/design-qa/starcap-site.png`
- Full source/implementation comparison: `tmp/design-qa/starcap-full-comparison.png`
- Focused character/world comparison: `tmp/design-qa/starcap-focus-comparison.png`
- Viewport: 1229 × 720 CSS px.
- State: `full-canvas`, desktop, home and task previews; light, dark, and compact toggles; Chinese website detail.

## Findings

- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain.
- Fonts and typography: the live theme uses the product's rounded system preset, compact UI weights, and readable Chinese/Latin fallbacks. The decorative title remains in the store preview, while applied-theme copy stays selectable and does not rely on rasterized control text.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the final hero keeps a calm left text field, the character on the right third, and the existing interactive suggestion-card hierarchy below. Rounded corners and soft elevation mirror the reference's friendly cream-and-mint surfaces without recreating a nonfunctional game-client shell.
- Colors and tokens: mint, cream, sky blue, coral red, warm gold, and forest green map directly to the theme palettes. The light palette preserves the sunrise concept; the dark palette uses deep evergreen surfaces with cream text and mint active states while retaining the same hero art.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: the 1672 × 941 production hero contains no UI, text, logos, or CSS/SVG substitutes. It preserves the scout's fluffy face, star cap, goggles, full outfit, flower-tipped blowgun, mushroom backpack, translucent mushrooms, cloud islands, flowers, and star particles. The 1254 × 1254 stamp supplies a dedicated high-resolution companion portrait rather than cropping the preview screenshot.
- Copy and content: `星愿提莫 · STARCAP TEEMO`, `斥候在线 · 孢子闪亮`, and `把灵感种下，等它长成星光` create a coherent fan-theme voice. The website description labels the subject through the theme name and does not claim official endorsement.
- Icons and controls: existing Lucide controls and native buttons remain interactive. Decorative mushrooms, flowers, goggles, and star seals are real generated raster assets, not emoji or handcrafted SVG substitutes.
- Accessibility: light surfaces use dark green text, dark surfaces use cream text, hero copy uses white with shadow over a controlled scrim, and active mode/density states remain visible. The website detail exposes landmarks, breadcrumb navigation, image alt text, and a native “使用该主题” button.

## Interaction and responsive verification

- Home and task previews rendered successfully from the real normalized preset and production assets.
- Light/dark mode toggles changed to their active states; the dark capture confirmed readable deep-green panels and mint controls.
- Compact mode changed to its active state and returned successfully.
- Website detail rendered at `/themes/starcap-teemo` with the correct preview, description, version, download link, and one-click theme action. Chinese and English detail routes were generated by the production build.
- No Vite error overlay, failed route, missing image, or browser-rendered runtime failure appeared. The in-app browser surface does not expose direct console-log export, so native console capture remains a P3 evidence gap.
- The existing website responsiveness rules are unchanged by this theme and remain covered by the shared gallery/detail breakpoints and production build. A new fixed-width mobile browser capture was unavailable in this pass, classified as P3 rather than an observed defect.

## Comparison history

1. The first combined comparison showed the character's boots clipped by the 340px hero crop, weakening the source's full-body collectible-skin silhouette (P2).
2. Increased `heroHeight` from `340` to `360` and moved `heroFocusY` from `0.50` to `0.58`.
3. Recaptured the same 1229 × 720 light home state as `starcap-home-v2.png`. The post-fix full and focused comparisons show the complete hat, ears, goggles, flower blowgun, backpack, tunic, trousers, and both boots inside the hero frame.
4. No further P0/P1/P2 differences remain. The live page structure is an intentional engine constraint; the reference's identity is carried by production assets, palette tokens, radius/font presets, copy, and effects.

## Follow-up polish

- [P3] Capture the freshly applied theme inside a live Codex task window after the native Mac UI session is available.
- [P3] Repeat the installed-app `codexui://theme/starcap-teemo` smoke test after the next signed desktop package is produced.

- Target state: a bright silver-haired poet-swordsman theme with white-gold surfaces, cobalt structure, an ice-blue sword array, a moon halo, and a cloud-city backdrop.
- The source is an aspirational dense three-column product concept. The implementation is evaluated as the same art direction expressed through the existing `full-canvas` theme engine; the live Codex interface remains interactive and is not baked into the production art.

## Implementation evidence

- Browser-rendered home preview: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-home-v2.png`
- Browser-rendered task preview: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-task.png`
- Browser-rendered website detail: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-site.png`
- Full source/implementation comparison: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-full-comparison.png`
- Focused hero-art comparison: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-focus-comparison.png`
- Viewport: 1229 × 720 CSS px.
- State: `full-canvas`, desktop, home and task previews; light, dark, and compact toggles; Chinese website detail.

## Findings

- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain.
- Fonts and typography: live product copy retains the system UI stack and compact control weights for clarity. The large decorative Chinese/serif title treatment remains in the store preview, while applied-theme text is selectable and readable instead of rasterized.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the implementation preserves a calm left text field and a dominant right character field inside the existing hero-and-cards Codex hierarchy. The source's dense three-column chrome is intentionally not hard-coded into the application.
- Colors and tokens: pearl white, mist blue, cobalt, restrained vermilion, and antique gold map directly to theme tokens. The reduced hero scrim preserves the luminous art while the left-side headline retains a shadow and darkened local field.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: the live production hero contains no mock UI, text, third-party logo, or CSS/SVG substitute. It keeps the silver-haired swordsman, gourd, blue-white robes, sword energy, moon, and cloud-city art direction at native 1672 × 941 resolution. The focused comparison confirms the subject is fully recognizable and no longer cropped at the forehead.
- Copy and content: `曜月谪仙 · MOONLIT IMMORTAL`, `月华在线 · 剑意清明`, and `长风破浪，代码成诗` form a consistent original theme voice. Public metadata uses a neutral original name rather than a game or character trademark.
- Icons and controls: the real preview keeps existing Lucide controls and native buttons. Decorative sword seals and character imagery stay within raster assets instead of impersonating live navigation.
- Accessibility: light-surface text uses dark blue foregrounds; hero copy uses white with shadow over a controlled scrim; mode and density controls are semantic buttons with visible active states. The website detail exposes landmarks, breadcrumb navigation, alt text, and a native “使用该主题” button.

## Interaction and responsive verification

- Home and task previews rendered from the real normalized preset and production assets.
- Light/dark toggle active states were exercised; both palettes intentionally share the same luminous art direction.
- Compact mode changed to its active state successfully.
- Website detail rendered at `/themes/moonlit-immortal`, exposed the correct preview, version, download link, and one-click theme action. Chinese and English routes were generated by the production build.
- No Vite error overlay, failed route, missing image, or browser-rendered runtime failure appeared during the QA run. The connected in-app browser does not expose a direct console-log export, so native console capture remains a P3 evidence gap.
- The full native Mac window could not be captured because the local UI session was locked. Engine tests, browser-rendered real components, asset loading, type checks, Electron build, and website build cover the implementation path; a live installed-app screenshot remains P3 follow-up polish.

## Comparison history

1. The first combined comparison showed the production hero focusing too low, cutting the lead character's forehead and weakening the source's face-first hierarchy (P2).
2. Moved `heroFocusY` from `0.44` to `0.22` and reduced `heroScrim` from `0.42` to `0.30`.
3. Recaptured the same 1229 × 720 home state as `moonlit-home-v2.png`. The post-fix full and focused comparisons show the complete head, readable face, blue-white robe silhouette, gourd, sword energy, and cloud-city field while preserving headline contrast.
4. No further P0/P1/P2 differences remain. The live layout difference is an intentional engine constraint; the source's visual identity is carried by production art, tokens, copy, and effects rather than a nonfunctional UI replica.

## Follow-up polish

- [P3] Capture the freshly applied theme inside a live Codex task window after the Mac session is unlocked.
- [P3] Repeat the installed-app custom-protocol smoke test after the next signed desktop package is produced.

# 曜月谪仙高清重制 Design QA

## Source visual truth

- User-approved reference: `/Users/canghe/Downloads/已生成图像 1.png`.
- Target state: a luminous ice-blue 16:10 full-window scene, a crisp close silver-haired swordsman on the right, a narrow deep-blue sidebar, a translucent blue conversation/code panel, four pale glass task cards, and a wide glass composer that does not obscure the subject.
- The implementation keeps live controls and text separate from the production artwork. The runtime wallpaper is a dedicated no-UI image generated from the source composition.

## Implementation evidence

- Final browser-rendered home: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-sharp-final-home.png`.
- Final browser-rendered task: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-sharp-final-task.png`.
- Final dark + compact + focused composer: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-sharp-final-dark-compact.png`.
- Final narrow 520px task: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-sharp-final-narrow-520.png`.
- Final full-view comparison: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-sharp-redesign-comparison-v3.png`.
- Final focused face comparison: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-sharp-redesign-face-comparison-v3.png`.
- Production hero: `assets/presets/moonlit-immortal/hero.png`, 1586 × 992 PNG.
- Primary viewport: 1280 × 720 CSS px, DPR 2. Responsive state: 520px component width.
- States: light home, task, dark, compact, composer text/focus, and narrow navigation.

## Findings

- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain.
- Fonts and typography: the implementation preserves the existing system UI/Lucide language while matching the reference's serif brand title, compact navigation, monospace code hierarchy, and restrained tracking. Text remains live, selectable, and readable.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: sidebar width is now 16.4% instead of 23%; the conversation occupies the left 52% of the main surface; four task cards and the composer end before the right character field. These proportions visibly align with the reference.
- Colors and tokens: the final wallpaper uses luminous cobalt, ice blue, pearl white, and restrained antique gold. Glass opacity was reduced for conversation, cards, and composer so the cloud city remains visible without losing foreground contrast.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: the former distant subject was replaced by a close production hero with a crisp face, individual silver hair strands, sharp gold filigree, fabric detail, sword hand, moon, and cloud-city atmosphere. The full-page main surface no longer applies `backdrop-filter: blur(1px)`, which was softening the complete wallpaper. The focused comparison uses the original production pixels rather than the downscaled browser capture and confirms the face is at least as sharp as the approved reference.
- Copy and content: the theme keeps its original `曜月谪仙 / Moonlit Immortal` identity and coherent xianxia code copy. No text, UI, buttons, or watermark are embedded in the production wallpaper.
- Icons and controls: all visible controls use the existing Lucide icon family and semantic buttons. Active, dark, compact, navigation, input, and focus states remain functional.
- Accessibility: pale cards retain dark-blue text, dark panels retain near-white text, focus has an ice-blue ring, and the 520px state keeps navigation, messages, code, and composer accessible without horizontal clipping. Screenshot evidence cannot prove full screen-reader behavior.

## Interaction and responsive verification

- Light/dark and compact controls changed their active classes successfully.
- The composer accepted `让人物保持清晰，同时保留月华玻璃层` and displayed its focused state.
- Home and task navigation rendered from the normalized production preset.
- The 520px view collapses the sidebar to an icon rail, keeps all persistent controls visible, and intentionally crops decorative background art before cropping functional content.
- In-app browser logs contained only Vite connection messages and the React DevTools development notice; no error, failed asset request, or React exception appeared.

## Comparison history

1. The user-supplied evidence exposed a P1 image-quality mismatch: the runtime subject was smaller and softer than the approved effect, and a full-main `backdrop-filter: blur(1px)` further blurred the wallpaper.
2. The first regenerated no-UI hero corrected character size and face detail, but the first full comparison showed a P2 lighting mismatch: the center-left was too dark, making the glass cards look heavy.
3. A single-change image edit preserved the character exactly while lifting only the city, clouds, and moonlight to the reference's ice-blue/pearl balance.
4. Removed the full-main blur; narrowed the sidebar; aligned conversation, task cards, and composer proportions; and reduced glass opacity. Recaptured the same home state plus task, dark/compact, and 520px states.
5. The final full and focused comparisons show the approved close character hierarchy, luminous palette, glass layering, and clear face/armor detail. No further P0/P1/P2 differences remain.

## Follow-up polish

- [P3] Capture the reapplied theme in a signed installed Codex window; browser QA intentionally uses a scaled harness for the fixed-DPR in-app capture, while face sharpness is verified from the original production pixels.
- [P3] Repeat the `codexui://theme/moonlit-immortal` smoke test in the next signed release package.

# 曜月谪仙欢迎区一致性 Design QA

## Source visual truth

- User-approved reference: `/Users/canghe/Downloads/已生成图像 1.png`.
- User mismatch evidence: `/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/.cowork-temp/codex-clipboard-df8fe86b-e8f4-4c08-8c66-4e114839ed20.png`.
- Target: replace the generic oversized welcome headline with the approved upper-left conversation/code panel while preserving native suggestions and composer behavior.

## Implementation evidence

- Browser implementation: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-welcome-final-browser.png`.
- Full comparison: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-welcome-final-comparison.png`.
- Focused comparison: `tmp/design-qa/moonlit-welcome-final-focus-comparison.png`.
- Viewport/state: 1586 × 992 CSS px, home, light.
- Runtime: `assets/inject/renderer-inject.js` plus Moonlit-scoped `assets/inject/dream-skin.css`.

## Findings

- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain.
- Typography: Songti heading, system conversation/status copy, and monospaced code with visible 01–11 line numbers match the approved hierarchy while remaining live text.
- Layout: the welcome panel, four task cards, and 134px composer now align to the reference's upper, lower-card, and bottom bands; the earlier unused vertical gap is gone.
- Colors: layered cobalt glass, ice-blue code surface, dark-navy syntax, antique-gold lines, and pale completion surface track the source while maintaining contrast.
- Image quality: the no-UI `hero.png` remains sharp and unblurred; `stamp.png` supplies the real avatar without screenshot cropping or placeholders.
- Content/behavior: the generic headline is hidden only for `moonlit-immortal`. The injected panel is informational, not fake navigation; real Codex suggestions, project selector, and composer remain functional.
- Accessibility: the panel and code have labels, the character image has alt text, decorative images use empty alt, and unrelated themes/routes receive no Moonlit panel.

## Interaction and verification

- Clicked project navigation, filled the composer, and triggered send; the semantic panel, four suggestion buttons, and labeled composer remained present.
- Browser logs showed only Vite/debug and React DevTools notices, with no app errors, React exceptions, or failed assets.
- Theme payload compilation is covered by `new Function(payload)` and the Moonlit test asserts the injected welcome identifier. Type checks, 61 tests, desktop build, website build, and whitespace validation passed.

## Comparison history

1. User evidence showed a P1 generic-headline mismatch.
2. Added the Moonlit-only welcome panel and preserved native controls.
3. First comparison found P2 proportion drift; matched panel, cards, and composer to the 1586 × 992 reference bands.
4. Focused comparison found P2 density drift; added line numbers, avatar/message spacing, and the completion surface.
5. The next comparison found P2 code contrast drift; adjusted the ice-blue surface and dark syntax tokens.
6. Final full and focused comparisons show aligned composition, density, glass hierarchy, live code, and crisp character art, with no P0/P1/P2 issues.

## Follow-up polish

- [P3] The source uses a custom crescent emblem and ornate filigree; the live UI retains the project's Lucide family until dedicated production icon assets exist.
- [P3] Capture the reapplied theme in the next signed installed build.

# 曜月谪仙任务正文可读性 Design QA

## Source visual truth

- User-reported live screenshot: `/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/.cowork-temp/codex-clipboard-45e93b9c-4827-43e8-bde2-7dacd82af2f7.png`.
- Target state: keep the full-canvas hero artwork, but remove near-black conversation and activity text from the bright blue image field. Long-form content needs a readable theme-native surface rather than a page-wide opaque overlay.

## Implementation evidence

- Live Codex task capture: `/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/.cowork-temp/moonlit-readability-final-target-1496x1000.png`.
- Full-view before/after comparison: `/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/.cowork-temp/moonlit-readability-comparison.png`.
- Focused text comparison: `/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/.cowork-temp/moonlit-readability-focus-comparison.png`.
- Viewport/state: 748 × 500 CSS px at DPR 2, producing the same 1496 × 1000 raster size as the source; live task thread, light shell, `moonlit-immortal` applied.
- Runtime stylesheet: `assets/inject/dream-skin.css`; preset version: `1.3.1`.

## Findings

- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain.
- Fonts and typography: native Codex system typography, weights, wrapping, and line height remain unchanged. Markdown paragraphs, headings, list text, timestamps, activity rows, and active reasoning shimmer now use ice-white semantic foregrounds instead of inherited near-black tokens.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: assistant Markdown receives 14px × 16px internal spacing in a 14px-radius reading surface. User messages keep their compact native bubble proportions, and the fix does not change sidebar, composer, or wallpaper geometry.
- Colors and visual tokens: assistant prose uses `#f5f9ff` over `rgba(4, 25, 62, .70)` with a restrained antique-gold border. User bubbles use a brighter cobalt surface. Conversation-body, secondary, summary, and shimmer tokens are remapped only inside the Moonlit task thread. The focused comparison shows the former black-on-blue failure replaced by consistently readable white-on-navy and white-on-blue combinations.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: `hero.png` is unchanged, remains full-canvas and sharp, and is not blurred or replaced. The new reading layer covers only message content, so the character and cloud-city composition remain visible.
- Copy and content: all user, assistant, tool, elapsed-time, and status copy remains live and unchanged. Links receive an ice-cyan treatment; code and tables keep their existing high-contrast dark treatment.
- Accessibility: the reported foreground/background contrast failure is removed. Focused text, activity labels, and active reasoning state are readable against both dark-city and bright-character portions of the wallpaper. Native keyboard/focus behavior is untouched.

## Interaction and runtime verification

- Reopened `检查主图主题定制` from the live sidebar, scrolled directly to the reported message, and captured the same task state at the source raster dimensions.
- Verified computed Markdown foreground `rgb(245, 249, 255)`, Markdown background `rgba(4, 25, 62, 0.7)`, and visible activity foreground `rgba(224, 239, 255, 0.88)`.
- The composer, sidebar navigation, activity expansion affordances, scroll-to-latest control, and live task content remained present after reapplication.
- Console backlog was checked. It contained pre-existing Codex favicon/CSP fetch failures and `aria-hidden` focus warnings from the host app, but no exception or asset failure from the Moonlit stylesheet/preset change.
- Type checks, 61 tests, desktop production build, website production build, and `git diff --check` passed.

## Comparison history

1. Source evidence showed a P1 accessibility/readability failure: Markdown and status text inherited near-black Codex tokens and sat directly on the detailed blue wallpaper.
2. First pass added the Moonlit-only navy reading card and ice-white Markdown text. Live inspection confirmed the message copy was fixed, but activity rows still inherited nested Codex conversation tokens, a remaining P1 readability issue.
3. Remapped conversation-body, secondary, summary, and shimmer tokens inside `.thread-scroll-container`; retained the stronger cobalt user bubble and separate dark code treatment.
4. Recaptured the exact reported turn at 1496 × 1000 and reviewed both the full and focused combined comparisons. Message, elapsed-time, activity, and active reasoning text are now readable without obscuring the wallpaper. No P0/P1/P2 issues remain.

## Follow-up polish

- [P3] Recheck token names after future Codex desktop UI updates, because host-generated CSS module and semantic token names can change between releases.

# AI 主题生成「图 2」画布优先改版 Design QA

## Source visual truth

- 用户选定参考图：`/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/.cowork-temp/ai-studio-design/reference-option-2.png`。
- 目标结构：墨黑桌面壳层、大幅主题预览画布、画布下方的紧凑配置摘要与对话式提示词输入，以及集中承载生成轨迹、候选图和微调的右侧栏。
- 目标交互：主要创作路径始终保持在一个工作台中，复杂配置放入弹层，生成中和完成后的操作不跳转页面。

## Implementation evidence

- 真实 Electron 空闲态：`/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/.cowork-temp/ai-studio-design/implementation-pass-1.png`。
- 真实 Electron 提示词态：`/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/.cowork-temp/ai-studio-design/implementation-final.png`。
- 生成设置弹层：`/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/.cowork-temp/ai-studio-design/settings-modal.png`。
- 最终并排对照：`/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/.cowork-temp/ai-studio-design/comparison-final.png`。
- 窗口：953 × 651 px；状态：Codex CLI 已就绪、空闲预览、灵感提示词已填充、生成按钮可用。

## Findings

- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain.
- 信息层级：预览画布成为页面主角，提示词 Composer 紧贴画布，创作轨迹与候选图独立成右栏，结构与图 2 一致。
- 视觉系统：延续现有暖墨黑、蜂蜜金、暖白文字和 Lucide 图标体系；没有引入与产品壳层冲突的新配色或图标风格。
- 状态设计：空闲、生成中、候选选择、主题合成、等待应用、完成、失败和取消均有对应文案、轨迹节点和操作出口。
- 交互设计：历史记录、首页／任务页预览、对比、配置摘要、参考图、灵感示例、快捷生成、候选选择、精炼、重新生成、应用、重试和删除均连接现有数据与任务 API。
- 配置层：生成方式、明暗外观、候选数量、参考图片与八种布局卡片统一收进生成设置弹层，避免主页面再次变成长表单。
- 响应式：桌面保持主画布＋右栏；窄窗口将右栏移到下方，并把设置弹层改成单列滚动，不裁切核心操作。
- 可访问性：预览标签使用 tab 语义，开关使用 `aria-pressed`，设置为 modal dialog，输入与图像操作均提供标签；键盘可用 `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` 发起生成、Escape 关闭覆盖层。

## Interaction and runtime verification

- 在真实 Electron 窗口切换到 AI 生成主题页，确认 Codex CLI 就绪状态、示例主题预览、配置摘要和四步创作轨迹正常显示。
- 打开生成设置弹层，确认三种生成方式、三种外观、候选数量、参考图片和九张布局选择卡（含自动选择）都进入可访问树且无溢出。
- 点击“灵感示例”后，提示词正确写入 Composer，发送按钮由禁用切换为可用；未触发真实生成任务，避免为了视觉验收额外创建用户数据。
- TypeScript/Astro 类型检查通过；64 项测试全部通过；Electron 生产构建通过；`git diff --check` 通过。

## Comparison history

1. 参考图显示旧页面的核心问题是表单感过强、预览权重不足、生成状态和候选操作分散。
2. 第一轮实装将页面改为大画布、底部 Composer 和右侧创作轨迹，并在真实 953 × 651 Electron 窗口捕获空闲态。
3. 并排对照确认画布、轨迹、配置摘要和 Composer 的比例与图 2 一致；随后验证设置弹层和灵感输入状态。
4. 最终对照中，空闲态右栏使用“等待中／候选为空”替代参考图的虚构生成进度，这是与真实数据状态一致的有意差异；不构成视觉缺陷。

## Follow-up polish

- [P3] 首次真实生成任务完成后，可再补一张包含进度环和两张候选图的运行态截图，用于发布素材，不影响当前功能完成度。
- [P3] 现有部分早期内置主题的 `preview.png` 主要是纹理底图；后续可为布局卡片补充更有信息量的真实界面预览资产。

# Blue Window Home Portal Design QA

**Comparison target**

- Source visual truth: `/Users/canghe/.codex/generated_images/019f6d53-2b44-7703-8395-9bdf833bf567/exec-8237f33b-a7d0-4ab1-9ec4-45b36c87304e.png`
- Rendered implementation: `/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/tmp/design-qa/blue-window-home.png`
- Full-view comparison: `/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/tmp/design-qa/blue-window-comparison.png`
- Focused center comparison: `/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/tmp/design-qa/blue-window-center-comparison.png`
- State: Codex home/new-task screen with `blue-window-messenger` active.
- CSS viewport: `945 × 633`.
- Source pixels: `1537 × 1023`; aspect-fitted to `945 × 629` and centered on a `945 × 633` comparison canvas.
- Implementation pixels: `1890 × 1266` at device scale factor 2; downsampled to `945 × 633` for comparison.

**Findings**

- No actionable P0, P1, or P2 differences remain.
- Fonts and typography: the Tahoma/Segoe UI/Microsoft YaHei stack preserves the reference's compact XP-era hierarchy. Welcome copy, section labels, row copy, metadata, and input placeholder remain readable at the tested viewport.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the three-column shell, hero, four-action strip, recent-work list, project context, and composer align with the source composition. Persistent controls remain inside the viewport with no horizontal document overflow.
- Colors and visual tokens: blue title bars, ice-blue borders, white panels, green online indicators, and orange level badge track the source palette and maintain readable contrast.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: the production implementation uses the existing high-resolution Blue Window mascot, wallpaper, and friend artwork. The mascot pose is the shipped standing brand asset rather than the generated waving pose; this is an intentional P3 asset constraint and does not change the hierarchy.
- Copy and content: welcome copy, four quick actions, recent work, project context, and composer placeholder match the selected design direction. The project label was restored during the final fidelity pass.
- Icons: production uses SVG icons cloned from Codex's own active icon set so the theme remains compatible with the host app and avoids bitmap placeholders. Shapes are simpler than the generated concept's illustrated icons; this is acceptable P3 polish.
- Interactions: the primary CTA and a quick-action card both focused the real composer successfully. Native submission remains proxied to the host Codex send action. No renderer exceptions were observed during application and interaction checks.

**Comparison history**

1. Initial capture showed excessive blank space above the hero and a large text send button. The home portal was extended into the native header gap, and the send control now reuses the native Codex send SVG.
2. A subsequent capture showed empty action icon wells after the host's generic suggestions unmounted. The portal now clones stable SVGs from the active Codex sidebar as a compatibility fallback.
3. Recent-work and project chips initially inherited a disclosure chevron. Icon selection was narrowed to the project row's leading icon, producing the intended folder symbol.
4. The focused comparison exposed a missing “选择项目” label. The project context received the missing hierarchy without displacing the composer.
5. Final capture verified visible hero, four visible action cards, project control, composer, sidebar, no horizontal overflow, working focus interactions, and zero runtime exceptions.

**Implementation Checklist**

- [x] Welcome hero uses real Blue Window artwork.
- [x] Four quick actions remain interactive.
- [x] Recent work and project context follow the selected layout.
- [x] Composer proxies Codex's native input and send behavior.
- [x] Task/conversation pages retain the existing retro messenger layout.
- [x] Theme-store preview and preset version are updated.
- [x] Type checks, tests, production build, live injection verification, interaction checks, and screenshot comparison pass.

**Follow-up Polish**

- P3: produce an official transparent waving pose for Codex 小蓝 if the brand asset set is expanded later.
- P3: add dedicated illustrated quick-action assets only if they can remain stable across Codex host updates.

final result: passed

# Account and points redesign QA

- Source visual truth: `/Users/canghe/.codex/generated_images/019f8e03-7663-7d43-941f-9b4008b07bf4/call_Um1UtjjzJt1sFibuhg5ksMq2.png`
- Implementation screenshot: `/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/tmp/design-qa/account-implementation-final.jpeg`
- Full-view comparison: `/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/tmp/design-qa/account-comparison-final.jpeg`
- Focused hero comparison: `/Users/canghe/responsibility/canghe/codex-ui/tmp/design-qa/account-comparison-hero-final.jpeg`
- Viewport/state: full-screen Electron window, authenticated account page, dark theme, zero-balance/empty-ledger live state.
- Source pixels: 1536 × 1024.
- Implementation capture pixels: 1147 × 716.
- Normalization: the source was top-aligned and cover-cropped to 1148 × 716; the implementation was normalized by one horizontal pixel to 1148 × 716 for the side-by-side comparison. The Computer Use capture is treated as a 1× desktop capture.

## Findings

No actionable P0, P1, or P2 visual differences remain.

- Fonts and typography: the implementation uses the existing SF Pro Text / PingFang SC system stack. Heading weight, muted body copy, numeric balance emphasis, truncation, and form text hierarchy preserve the visual target without introducing another font.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the identity/wallet hero, four-part recharge strip, and profile/activity split match the selected direction. The normal window stacks the responsive regions without overlap; the full-screen view preserves the two-column hierarchy.
- Colors and visual tokens: the existing warm-ink background, honey-gold wallet accent, violet creator accent, dividers, and restrained elevation map closely to the target. Contrast remains readable for primary text, muted text, and form controls.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: a real login avatar is used when available. The email-login fallback is a generated 512 × 512 WebP asset rather than a placeholder; a custom uploaded avatar overrides both. The circular crop is sharp and includes a visible upload affordance.
- Copy and content: the implementation keeps the product's real point packs (60/330/800 and ¥6/¥30/¥68), rather than the inaccurate values produced by the visual mock. Full email addresses remain hidden.
- Icons: visible controls use the project's established Lucide icon family with consistent stroke weight and optical sizing. Alipay recharge is identified by both a blue payment mark and text.
- States and interactions: account navigation, profile-editor scroll/focus, input focus and disabled save states, refresh, native avatar picker, pending-payment state, pack selection, empty ledger, and sign-out affordance are represented. Financial purchase actions were not executed during visual QA.
- Accessibility: controls are semantic buttons/inputs with labels or titles, the avatar has descriptive alt text, focus styling is visible, and responsive layouts avoid clipping.

## Comparison history

### Pass 1

- Evidence: `tmp/design-qa/account-comparison-pass-1.jpeg`
- [P2] The extra page title/description toolbar pushed the identity hero too far down and weakened the selected design's profile-first hierarchy.
- Fix: removed the redundant toolbar and moved refresh into the creator action cluster beside “编辑资料”.

### Pass 2

- Evidence: `tmp/design-qa/account-comparison-final.jpeg` and `tmp/design-qa/account-comparison-hero-final.jpeg`
- Result: the hero begins at the same visual level as the source, identity and wallet balance correctly share the top row, the recharge strip follows immediately, and the lower profile/activity columns align without crowding.

## Intentional differences and test gaps

- The source mock contains illustrative balance, sales, and ledger data. The implementation screenshot uses the signed-in account's real zero-balance/empty-ledger state and its real login avatar.
- The source highlights “创作者中心” in the sidebar; the implementation correctly highlights the signed-in account item because this is the account page.
- The new account, wallet, avatar, and point APIs are implemented locally but not deployed to `theme.codexguide.ai`, so the current development log still records expected 404 responses from that production host. Network-backed avatar upload and payment completion require the backend migration/deployment before end-to-end testing.

## Verification

- Primary account navigation: passed.
- “编辑资料” scroll and focus interaction: passed.
- Narrow-window responsive layout: passed.
- Full-screen desktop layout: passed.
- Renderer visual console/build state: no renderer layout exceptions observed; known server 404s are documented above.
- TypeScript and Astro checks: passed.
- Automated tests: 163 passed.
- Electron production build: passed after final image-asset optimization; the fallback avatar bundles as a 14.14 kB WebP.

## Follow-up polish

- P3: once live ledger data is available, verify long theme titles and four-digit reward values in the activity rows.
- P3: consider a crop-position editor in a later avatar iteration; the current upload uses a safe centered square crop.

final result: passed

   - Earlier evidence: 任务消息、文件变更卡片和输入框落在错误层级，部分文字与背景接近。
   - Fix: 提升原生 Codex 主界面层级，任务主表面改为半透明，并补齐消息、菜单、代码和输入框的深色 token。

3. P2 新版任务页缺少旧消息标记。
   - Earlier evidence: 当前 Codex 任务 DOM 没有 `article`、`.message` 或 `data-message-author-role`，稳定标记为 `.thread-scroll-container`。
   - Fix: 将 `.thread-scroll-container` 加入任务内容检测。
   - Post-fix evidence: 连续四次检测均保持 `home: false`、`ui: is-task`，随后返回首页连续五次保持首页状态。

4. P2 首页项目工具条沿用浅色背景。
   - Earlier evidence: `--color-token-side-bar-background` 计算值为 `#f6f6f6`。
   - Fix: 为 `cinematic-live` 首页补齐工具条、文字、边框和悬停 token。
   - Post-fix evidence: 计算值为 `rgba(3, 12, 16, 0.7)`，最终首页截图中项目栏与输入框视觉一致。

# Download Page Design QA

## Evidence

- Source visual truth: `/Users/canghe/.codex/generated_images/019f9db6-bbd7-77c1-a111-ae14a241f76f/call_kHWvZgA7E8G1dLFoqEivMTrG.png`

- Full-view comparison: `/tmp/codex-ui-download-design-compare-final.png`
- Desktop CSS viewport: `1536 × 1024`
- Desktop implementation pixels: `1521 × 1014`
- Mobile CSS viewport: `390 × 844`
- Density normalization: 1x browser capture. The source was resized to `1521 × 1014` before the side-by-side comparison.
- State: Chinese download page, Apple silicon recommendation active, mobile navigation closed for the final screenshots.

## Full-view Comparison

The final desktop capture preserves the selected composition: dark atmospheric hero, two-line editorial headline, real Codex-UI client preview, three-column download dock, contextual Windows note, and a full-width warm-paper installation section. The first installation heading begins inside the initial viewport at the same transition point as the source.

The implementation uses the repository's existing mascot in the header. The generated concept used a gold lettermark that is not part of the current brand assets. This is an accepted product constraint.

## Focused Evidence

The desktop hero and download dock remain legible at 1x inside the full-view comparison, so an additional desktop crop was not required. The mobile download dock received a dedicated capture at `390 × 844`; all five download links remain visible, aligned, and comfortably tappable after scrolling to the selector.

## Required Fidelity Surfaces

- Fonts and typography: Chinese serif display hierarchy, sans-serif interface labels, monospaced metadata, line height, wrapping, and optical weight match the selected direction. The headline stays on two lines at the desktop target.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: hero columns, product image, dock, Windows note, and light-section transition align with the source proportions. Desktop and mobile have no horizontal overflow.
- Colors and visual tokens: midnight navy, cobalt blue, warm gold, pale text, and warm paper map closely to the concept. Contrast remains clear across download actions and metadata.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: the real `theme-gallery-client.jpg` asset is used through Astro image optimization. It remains sharp and correctly cropped on desktop and mobile.
- Copy and content: platform names, architecture requirements, DMG/ZIP/EXE actions, Windows preview status, installation guidance, and version metadata are preserved.

## Interaction Checks

- Five installer links point to the expected platform, architecture, and format API routes.
- Runtime recommendation selected Apple silicon on the macOS test environment.
- Mobile navigation opens and exposes Theme gallery, How it works, FAQ, GitHub, and Download.
- Browser console contained no warnings or errors.

## Comparison History

1. Initial capture found P2 differences: the title wrapped to three lines, the dock pushed the Windows note below the first viewport, and the Windows icon rendered as a filled square.
2. The hero grid, product image ratio, headline sizing, stage spacing, dock density, and Windows icon treatment were corrected. The next capture restored the two-line title and brought the dock plus Windows note into view.
3. The side-by-side comparison then found a P2 section-width mismatch: the warm installation background had dark gutters. A full-width section with an inner content shell fixed the mismatch.
4. Final desktop and mobile captures show no actionable P0, P1, or P2 findings.

## Follow-up Polish

- P3: A future brand pass could replace the current mascot with an approved gold desktop-app lockup if that asset is formally adopted.
- P3: A subtle raster star-field could bring the background even closer to the generated concept.

final result: passed
