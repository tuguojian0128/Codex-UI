Ported components:

- `assets/inject/renderer-inject.js` — in-renderer theming runtime (idempotent
  injection, MutationObserver re-apply, cleanup), carried over nearly verbatim.
- `assets/inject/dream-skin.css` — decorative stylesheet.
- `electron/engine/*` — TypeScript port of `macos/scripts/injector.mjs`
  (CDP session, loopback validation, Codex shell probing, payload assembly,
  watch loop, soft verification).
- `electron/platform/codex-macos.ts` — Node/TypeScript port of the discovery,
  stop/launch and port-ownership logic from `macos/scripts/common-macos.sh`.
- `electron/config/codex-config.ts` — port of `macos/scripts/theme-config.mjs`
  (appearance key backup/restore for `~/.codex/config.toml`).
- `electron/themes/store.ts` — validation rules ported from
  `macos/scripts/write-theme.mjs` and `injector.mjs` (schema v1, text
  truncation, color whitelist, 16 MB image cap, path-traversal guard).
